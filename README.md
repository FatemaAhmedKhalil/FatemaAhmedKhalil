# About Me 
a fresh graduate Communication Engineer with a passion for Embedded Systems. Iâ€™ve dedicated my academic and project work to mastering embedded development, with a focus on microcontrollers, real-time systems, and hardware-software integration.

I have a solid understanding of automotive systems and Embedded Linux, and Iâ€™m eager to bring my skills to the cutting-edge of embedded technology. My journey in embedded systems has fueled my interest in low-level programming, firmware development, and creating efficient, optimized solutions for complex systems.

Iâ€™m driven by a passion to learn, grow, and contribute to impactful projects. Currently, Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities in the embedded industry where I can apply my knowledge, collaborate with talented professionals, and continue honing my skills to contribute meaningfully to innovation in the embedded space.
